Possible bugs or Known Issues 

[IA001]
1. While controling image visibility from the breakpoint adjustment, left image to left-most visible images is always visible, whereas it should not. 
   e.g. 
   - There are 7 images in the slider in the right sequence.  Img1, Img2, ..., Img7 
   - Expected: Only Img1-Img2-Img3 are expected to be visible within the given breakpoint.
   - Actual:  Img7 is also visible which is not expected    

2. While controling image visibility from the dots, image visibility behaviour is the same except the TC5 and TC6 where both the right to the right-most and left to the lef-most images are visble, whereas they should not be visible.
