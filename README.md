# IntegrationTestingWithCypress.io
This repository contains the code to test react leaf carousel using cypress.io 


## Prerequisites
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
Cypress  
An IDE or Terminal  
Chrome Browser  
[Cypress pipe for click functionality](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-pipe?activeTab=readme)

## Project Structure 
> All .js files *such as* `careousel.js`, `App.js`, `index.js` are in **src** folder  
> All public files and resources are in **public** folder with carousel images inside `pubilc/images` folder  
> All test related files are recommended to be in **cypress** folder as per the official documentation, unlike react test library where `.test` file should in a folder with its `.js` file  

## Prject Configuration
The baseURL is set to **"http://localhost:3000"** in `cypress.json`. Make sure port is open to listen. 


## Build Prject

1. Clone Repository
``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Iiqra/IntegrationTestingWithCypress.io
```
2. Build Project

``` sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build 
```
3. Open & run Cypress runner for Scripts execution 
``` sh
$ npm install cypress-pipe -D
$ node_modules/.bin/cypress open
$ npm run cypress
```
4. Run Tests  
After step3, the Cypress runner will launch and you can run `.spec.js` test files from the Cypress launched interface

5. Result
Here is the test execution results of test cases

# Run docker images for node and cypress 
There are 3 files related to docker. 1- node.Dockerfile [this is for building node docker image], 2- Dockerfile [default file to build cypress docker image], and 3- docker-compose.yml file for running both images in one container as cypress process depends on node. 

Build node Image
```
$ docker build -t nodeimage:test -f node.Dockerfile
```
Run node image

```
$ docker run nodeimage:test
```
Run docker-compose file 

```
$ docker-compose up
```

After this, all the test specs will execute and you will see the logs/output generated by cypress.

Please note that I have built node image separately and given cypress image path in docker-compose file. It can either be done in any of the following ways;

1. Build node and cypress both images separately using node.Dockerfile and Dockerfile. And then given the images of node and cypress in the docker-compose file, and finally run it using `docker-compose up` command.  
2. Build node and cypress both images in the docker-compose file by giving the image paths of both file node.Dockerfile and Dockerfile directly in the docker-compose steps. 

Also, if you have to run it again, following commands will help you go through the steps;

```
$ docker ps [OPTIONS]	$ docker ps -a 	Show all containers (default shows just running)
$ docker images 	$ docker images 	Show all images 
$ docker inspect image_name	$ docker inspect testapp_node_1	Show image details 
$ docker rmi image_name	$ docker rmi testapp_cypress
$ docker rmi nodeimage:testnode	Delete docker image
$ docker rm containerID	$ docker rm a134aefc52b0	Delete docker container 
$ docker build -t imagename:tag -f fine_name . 	$ docker build -t nodeimage:test -f node.Dockerfile .	Build docker image, give it image name and friendly tag using the docker file
$ docker run imagename:tag	$ docker run nodeimage:testnode	Run built image using imagename and tag
$ docker logs containerID	$ docker logs 8493ac9ffa65	Show all the logs of given container
$ docker-compose ps [OPTIONS] 	$ docker-compose ps -a	Show containers for a docker-compose file 
$ docker-compose down		Down docker-compose process
$ docker-compose up		Up docker compose process 
```
